## Create New App

The fastest way to kickstart your React application using Ignite UI for React is using the Ignite UI CLI.

```
  npm i -g igniteui-cli
  ig new <project name> --framework=react --type=igr-ts
  cd <project name>
  ig add grid <component name>
  ig start
```

This will initialize a new application and add a single page to it with a pre-configured grid component. If you need to add other components and therefore the packages they reside in, you can either init the Ignite UI CLI prompt again using the `ig` command and choose from the list of templates or use the following commands to install the packages needed directly.

```
  npm install --save igniteui-react-charts igniteui-react-core
  npm install --save igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core
  npm install --save igniteui-react-gauges igniteui-react-core
  npm install --save igniteui-react-grids igniteui-react-core 
  npm install --save igniteui-react-maps igniteui-react-core
  npm install --save igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core
  npm install --save igniteui-react-spreadsheet igniteui-react-core
```

Or

```
  yarn add igniteui-react-charts igniteui-react-core
  yarn add igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core
  yarn add igniteui-react-gauges igniteui-react-core
  yarn add igniteui-react-grids igniteui-react-core
  yarn add igniteui-react-maps igniteui-react-core
  yarn add igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core
  yarn add igniteui-react-spreadsheet igniteui-react-core
```

After executing those commands, your new project will be built and served. It will automatically open in your default browser and you will be able to use Ignite UI for React components in your project.

## Importing Modules

First we have to import the required modules of the components we want to use. We will go ahead and do this for the [Category Chart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-react/react/components/categorychart.html) component.

```tsx
import { IgrCategoryChartModule } from "igniteui-react-charts/ES5/igr-category-chart-module";

IgrCategoryChartMapModule.register();
```

## Using Components

We are now ready to use the `CategoryChart` component in our markup! Let's go ahead and define it:

```tsx
// App.txs
render() {
    return (
        <div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%" }}>
             <IgrCategoryChart dataSource={this.state.data}
                   width="700px"
                   height="500px">
             </IgrCategoryChart>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Running Application

Finally, we can run our new application by using one of the following commands:

```
npm run start
```

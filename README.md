# Create New App

In VS Code, select Terminal menu, New Terminal option, and type this command in terminal window:

  - **npx create-react-app my-app-name --typescript**

Or

  - **yarn create react-app my-app-name --typescript**

Next, you need to open the my-app-name folder in VS Code app and install the following packages for Ignite UI for React using these commands:
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-charts igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-gauges igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-grids igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-maps igniteui-react-core**

Or
  
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-charts igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-gauges igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-grids igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-maps igniteui-react-core**

Lastly, you can build for production or start your application with these commands:
  - **npm run-script build**
  - **npm run-script start**

After executing those simple commands, your new project will be built and served. It will automatically open in your default browser and you will be able to use Ignite UI for React components in your project.

# Update Existing App
What if you want to use React in an existing React CLI project (one that you have from before)? We have you covered! All you have to do is execute these commands:

  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-charts igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-gauges igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-grids igniteui-react-core**
  - **npm install --save igniteui-react-maps igniteui-react-core**

Or

  - **yarn add igniteui-react-charts igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-excel igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-gauges igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-grids igniteui-react-core**
  - **yarn add igniteui-react-maps igniteui-react-core**

This will automatically install packages for React, along with all of their dependencies, font imports and styles references to the existing project.

# Importing Modules

First we have to import the required modules of the components we want to use. We will go ahead and do this for the [**Catgeory Chart**](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-react/react/components/categorychart.html) component.

```
import { IgrCategoryChartModule } from "igniteui-react-charts/ES5/igr-category-chart-module";
IgrCategoryChartMapModule.register();
```

# Using Components

We are now ready to use the `CategoryChart` component in our markup! Let's go ahead and define it:

```
// App.txs
render() {
    return ( 
        <div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%" }}>
             <IgrCategoryChart dataSource={this.state.data}
                   width="700px"
                   height="500px">
              </IgrCategoryChart>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# Running Application

Finally, we can run our new application by using one of the following commands:

- **npm run-script start**
